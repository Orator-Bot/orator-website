        <p>1. We doesn't allow usage of Orator for illegal uses. Making NSFW sounds and other type of TTS messages which aren't allowed to be done in a public voice channel, that can lead to ban of the user or the server owner or the whole server. Things we consider: - If the whole server is liable behind this issue, the server owner will be banned from using Orator and the whole server will get Blacklisted. - If a single person is liable behind this, then under certain cases that single person will be banned from using Orator.</p>
        <div className="py-3"></div>
        <p>2. Servers Breaking Discord's ToS can also get banned. Though every cases aren't same and we may consider some of them.</p>
        <div className="py-3"></div>
        <p>3. If your server is found liable, or any user is found liable of doing something illegal, an issue notice will be sent to the Server Owner or an Admin about that issue. And the bot will be removed from the server as a warning. Though clearing data about that server depends on us.</p>
        <div className="py-3"></div>
        <p>4. If we are asked by Discord for taking any steps, we will do it without giving any warnings.</p>
        <div className="py-3"></div>
        <p>‚ä≥ While using the bot, you cannot use it in a way that harms other users for troll purposes.</p>
